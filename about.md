I have a Ph.D in natural resource economics, I work for the government as a research scientist.

My research focuses on modeling complex economic-ecological systems and using empirical models to inform policy.  

My position affords me the opportunity to apply many types of mathematical and statistically motivated models to human behavior.  I also use a variety of computational tools - some database management, some R, some Python, some other shit - to get my job done. The blog is a good outlet for commenting on the utility of various models and platforms.  I used to blog at www.thesamuelsoncondition.com.  I didn't love Wordpress...I haven't yet decided whether to redirect to that domain or just take up blogging under my actual name.

I created <b> The Samuelson Condition </b> as a place where I could comment on policy issues that interest me as well as contribute to the growing stock of public information on technical programming.  

<em>The obligatory disclaimer</em>: this is my personal blog.  Rest assured no government resources (time, hardware, software, etc) were allocated to this undertaking.
