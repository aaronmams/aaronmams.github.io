This page will be used to periodically post papers on various topics that I'm reading each week or so.

Although I haven't really set any hard metrics for evaluation, I make an honest effort to learn at least a handful of new things each week.  So far I've found the totally manufactured pressure of trying to update my blog once a week does a pretty good job of motivating me to look for new data sets, new modeling techniques, or new code packages/languages/functionalities.  Basically, it helps me find new things to DO.

In addition to learning how to do new things, it's also (I think) pretty important to expose one's self to new ideas regularly.  In this regard I have set more concrete goals for myself.  In addition to any readings or resources I need to consult in the natural course of doing my job, I aim to: 

* read at least one recent peer reviewed paper from a top tier journal (American Economic Review, Journal of Economic Perspectives, Science, Applied Ecology, etc.) or working paper from a recent Ph.D (the new Ph.Ds are usually pretty plugged in to the 'hot' topics) 
* read at least one book chapter
* read/peruse one software development tutorial/technical manual/GitHub repo.

I'm not always great about meeting these goals....so I'm hoping a little more manufactured pressure in the form of of a periodic 'Readings' update will give me the same kick-in-the-ass I get from the blog.

## Economics

Two papers from a collegaue at the [University of Dayton, Nancy Haskell](https://sites.google.com/site/nancylhaskell/home/research):

* The Pull of Popularity: Explaining Conformity in Student Behaviors
* Overcompensating for Better or for Worse: Effects of Being Racially, Ethnically, & Socioeconomically Different from Peers 

There is a really interesting literture in Economics (that I don't know nearly enough about) that seeks to better understand how we form relationships and the formation and maintainence of those relationships influences various behaviors and outcomes in our lives. 

## Modeling

[Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/15/3932.abstract)

## Miscellaneous Programming

[This blog post on building slack bots](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html)

[And this blog post](https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/how-to-write-a-slack-bot-with-python-code-examples-4ed354407b98#.ap4xn8f0h)

[And this wiki](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/slackbots/)

My brother-in-law recently, probably inadvertently, reminded me that technical skills like computer programming don't have to be applied to an immediate world-changing problem to be worthy of time-investment...They can be worthy pursuits simply because they're fun.  The backdrop for this is that I was mentioning that I really wanted to commit some time to learning how to build slack-bots in Python but I hadn't yet figured out a problem in my realm that a slack-bot would really solve (there are probably exceptions but not many scientist I know use slack or other IM clients to chat with colleagues in real time...the pace of scientific discover usually doesn't require immediate co-worker feedback).  My brother-in-law said that at his old job they programmed a slack-bot to listen on all channels and if anyone said, "we're out of beer" the bot responded by ordering more.  

## Books
