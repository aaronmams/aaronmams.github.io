This page will be used to periodically post papers on various topics that I'm reading each week or so.

Although I haven't really set any hard metrics for evaluation, I try pretty hard to learn at least a handful of new things each week.  So far I've found the totally manufactured pressure of trying to update my blog once a week does a pretty good job of motivating me to look for new data sets, new modeling techniques, 

## Economics

Two papers from a collegaue at the [University of Dayton, Nancy Haskell](https://sites.google.com/site/nancylhaskell/home/research):

* The Pull of Popularity: Explaining Conformity in Student Behaviors
* Overcompensating for Better or for Worse: Effects of Being Racially, Ethnically, & Socioeconomically Different from Peers 

There is a really interesting literture in Economics (that I don't know nearly enough about) that seeks to better understand how we form relationships and the formation and maintainence of those relationships influences various behaviors and outcomes in our lives. 

## Modeling

[Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/15/3932.abstract)

## Miscellaneous Programming

[This blog post on building slack bots](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html)

[And this blog post]()https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/how-to-write-a-slack-bot-with-python-code-examples-4ed354407b98#.ap4xn8f0h

[And this wiki](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/slackbots/)

My brother-in-law recently, probably inadvertently, reminded me that technical skills like computer programming don't have to be applied to an immediate world-changing problem to be worthy of time-investment...They can be worthy pursuits simply because they're fun.  The backdrop for this is that I was mentioning that I really wanted to commit some time to learning how to build slack-bots in Python but I hadn't yet figured out a problem in my realm that a slack-bot would really solve (there are probably exceptions but not many scientist I know use slack or other IM clients to chat with colleagues in real time...the pace of scientific discover usually doesn't require immediate co-worker feedback).  My brother-in-law said that at his old job they programmed a slack-bot to listen on all channels and if anyone said, "we're out of beer" the bot responded by ordering more.
