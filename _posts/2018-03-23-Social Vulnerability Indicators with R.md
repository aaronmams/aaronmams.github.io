Here is something I've been doing at work that I'm kinda proud of.  It's a fully reproducible spatial visualization of social vulnerability indicators by Census Tract for the West Coast.  The entire project is available for download on my [GitHub svi-tools repository here](https://github.com/aaronmams/svi-tools).

## Background

*Social Vulnerability refers to the resilience of communities when confronted by external stresses on human health, stresses such as natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks.*

The Center for Disease Control, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency, NOAA, and a ton of other state and federal government agencies use social vulnerability indicators for a variety of purposes...among them:

* The CDC and various state departments of health use social vulnerability indicators to scree for communities that may be of particularly high risk of disruption from disease outbreaks or other adverse public health events.
* The EPA uses social vulnerability indicators to construct their [Environmental Justice Screener](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen). Their Environmental Justice Screener is meant to identify and protect vulnerable communities from environmental hazards like water quality degredation.
* NOAA uses social vulnerability to identify communities that might be particularly adversely affected by commercial fisheries management policies.

Social Vulnerability Indexes are generally constructed using data related to the following themes and metrics:
