Here is something I've been doing at work that I'm kinda proud of.  It's a fully reproducible spatial visualization of social vulnerability indicators by Census Tract for the West Coast.  The entire project is available for download on my [GitHub svi-tools repository here](https://github.com/aaronmams/svi-tools).

## Background

*Social Vulnerability refers to the resilience of communities when confronted by external stresses on human health, stresses such as natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks.*

The Center for Disease Control, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency, NOAA, and a ton of other state and federal government agencies use social vulnerability indicators for a variety of purposes...among them:

* The CDC and various state departments of health use social vulnerability indicators to scree for communities that may be of particularly high risk of disruption from disease outbreaks or other adverse public health events.
* The EPA uses social vulnerability indicators to construct their [Environmental Justice Screener](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen). Their Environmental Justice Screener is meant to identify and protect vulnerable communities from environmental hazards like water quality degredation.
* NOAA uses social vulnerability to identify communities that might be particularly adversely affected by commercial fisheries management policies.

Social Vulnerability Indexes are generally constructed using data related to the following themes and metrics:

## Problem

### problem 1
The first problem or challenge that one normally encounters when trying to replicate or construct a new Social Vulnerability Index is that the shear amount of data required.  There are 16 key metrics that feed into most Social Vulnerability Indicies.  However, many of these metrics are aggregations of 10-20 primary data series.  

For example, the indicator 'No High School Diploma' is generally constructed from The Census Bureau's American Communities Survey table B15001.  Most applications that I have encountered actually use for this metric, "Percent of the population 25 and over with some high school education but no diploma."  In order to contruct the metric "percent of population 25 and over with some high school education but no diploma", one needs the individual data series:

* B15001_013E, males age 25-34 with some high school but no diploma
* B15001_021E, males age 35-44 with some high school but no diploma
* etc, etc,
* B15001_078E, females age 65 and up with some high school but no diploma

a total of 8 individual data series.

### problem 2
The 2nd problem one generally encounters in the construction of a Social Vulnerability Index is that getting the necessary data series from the Census Bureau's Data Web Mart, [The American Fact Finder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) can be quite clunky.  To get the data series mentioned above to calculate the metric, "Percent of the population 25 and over with some high school but no diploma" I follow these steps:

* select "Guided Search" from the landing page
* select "information about people", then "educational attainment" from the *Topics* page
* select geography type: Census Tract, state: CA, county: all counties from the *Geography* page
* select "No, I'm not looking for race or ethic data" from the *Race/Ethnic Groups* page
* select table B15001 from the results page

What I get is a table with the educational attainment of 5 age groups broken down by gender.  If I also select "Modify Table" --> "transpose" then I get a sensible looking table with Census Tracts along the rows and educational attainment estimates in the columns. Then I can export the results to a .csv file.  

All-in it took me somewhere in the neighborhood of 5-8 minutes to get these data using the American Fact Finder.

### problem 3
The biggest problem I have with getting all 50-odd primary data series necessary to contruct a Social Vulnerability Index using the [American Fact Finder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/guided_search.xhtml) is that there are so many steps to follow that it's REALLY hard to completely document all the steps in a way that makes your particular index reproducable.
