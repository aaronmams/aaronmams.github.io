## A Quick California Insurance Example

This exercise was shamelessly pirated from [Kevin Johnson's badass post](http://www.kevjohnson.org/making-maps-in-r/). I got shapefiles for Census Tract Boundaries and California County Boundaries from the Cartographic Boundaries aisle of the Census Bureau's TIGER Products Store.  You can download the shapefiles 

[here](http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html)  

Or you can get them from the GitHub Repo I set up

[Aaron's R-spatial Repo]()
