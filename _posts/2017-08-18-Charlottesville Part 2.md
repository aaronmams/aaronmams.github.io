I wrote a pretty depressing post about the Charlottesville debacle on Tuesday.  A Jewish friend of mine commented on that post, saying something to effect of

*I'm starting to feel suffocated and feeling like, shit we gotta get out of here.*

I was pretty bummed out that I couldn't find something positive and uplifting to say.  After thinking about it for a while, I realized that was because I can see an awful lot of likely scenarios where, in the immediate future, racial/ethnic tensions in this county get a lot worse before they get better.

I know that's not a really sunny opener so I hope you'll indulge more of my pessimism.  

# Punchline

My thesis here is that the white uprising in Charlottesville was bad.  The near universal condemnation of these assholes was promising...but things in this country could get much worse before they get better.  

The reason I think this is that I think The Angry Tangerine is running out of options. I think he knows he's running out of options, and a full blown race-war is starting to look like his last best chip.  I know that sounds crazy but hear me out.

# Out of Options

Trump's constituencies are vanishing:

* his manufacturing council imploded because companies can't be tied to a guy with Nazi sympathies
* Congressional and Senate Republicans are abandoning him at a pretty steady clip
* His approval has always been low but he's generally been able to pinch a few points and jump into the mid to high 30s with a flurry of 'fake news' claims.  Now, not even his 'fake news' gambit can get him out of the low 30s.

He knows he's running out of moves and he's starting to feel trapped.  That might be satisfying except that a cornered animal is the most dangerous kind.  

Despite the rapid deterioration of support for Trump among Republicans of all flavors, there is one group left that has never wavered in their support for Cheeto Jesus: white men afraid of black people/brown people/muslims/people without penises taking their stuff.

Here's the thing, the number of groups supporting him is shrinking like a dick in an ice bath.  But he can still win re-election if only one group supports him...as long as that one group is really, really big.  Right now the group that supports him is a group called: scared white men.  His path forward is pretty obvious to me: make more scared white men.  

# Point of Clarification

I'm obviously not saying that inciting a race-war is what I would advise.  I'm saying that Trump is at a cross-roads and he's going to have to choose a path. He can either

A. Try to broaden his appeal, or

B. Try to calcify and energy his white male base

He can't do both.  His response to Charlottesville has guaranteed that.  He only has 2 choices: 

1. Forcefully, disavow White Supremacists and hope he can cobble together a slightly more diverse coalition that he had in 2016, or

2. Pander like a motherfucker to scared white men.

# Am I Crazy?

If you think I'm crazy just consider for a moment that even today he released a statement saying that removing confederate monuments was, "foolish."  Whether or not you really believe that, it takes some fucking stones to say it a few days after White Nationalists used your name to advocate for ethnic cleansing.  

To make a statement like that, at this point, took a calculation. The calculation probably looked something like this:

A. I need to distance myself from these Nazi, White Nationalists, Confederate slave era nostalgia kooks.  The best thing to do is just not say anything for a while.  Republicans forgave me for "grab em by the pussy", they forgave me for "they're sending rapist and murders", they even forgave me for attacking a gold star family.  They'll forgive me for this as long as I don't make it worse.

B.  I'm in too deep, there is no way to distance myself from these people now, my best shot is to show them (militant white people) I'm still with them.

He sized up the situation as recently as 11:00 am today and said, "Fuck it, I'm going with Option B."

# Fight or Flight

Right now even Donald Trump realizes that his party is going to mount a primary challenge against him in 2020 (my call right now is that it will be Kasich because the RNC won't want to run any of thier rising stars in this environment).  Let's just think about that Industrial Midwest vote (WI, MI, OH, KY) because there is no world in which Trump wins the 2020 nomination without those voters.

* his manufacturing council falling apart severely limits his ability to sell his "good for business" angle
* it is highly unlikely that he will have an infrastructure spending bill passed in time to campaign on ahead of a 2020 primary.  This compromises his "job creator" pitch.
* it is also extremely unlikely that he will have made any tangible progress on the issue of trade-balances since WTO trade complaints take a while to play out.  This can really hurt him in the Upper Midwest where union folks voted for him on the expectation that he would stop cheap Chinese and Mexican steel from coming into the U.S.

Donald Trump knows 3 things about the white male voters in the Industrial Midwest:

1. He really, really, really, needs them

2. He probably won't be able to dupe them into believing he's a job creator a 2nd time, and

3. They will forgive an awful lot if they think their shit is in jeopardy

In 2016 Trump made these people believe that their extinction was certain under a Clinton Presidency and that their resurgence was equally certain under a Trump Presidency.  These voters happily risked the health and safety of their non-white, non-male, non-christian neighbors because Trump made them believe it was a simple matter of self preservation.  

In 2016 he constructed this false choice using economic themes: globalization, technology adoption, and affirmative action under Clinton are going to guarantee that your job gets reassigned to a robot, an immigrant, or a woman.  I can make sure you keep your job and I'll even bring back thousands more jobs for all your white, male buddies.

In 2020 he won't have that economic lever to lean on.  He's going to have to find another way to convince these people that only he can protect their existence.  The following 5 points paint what I think is a rather bleak reality.

1. We already know the Trump strategists are familiar with the *pander to downtrodden white people* tactic from the way they deployed it in 2016.

2. It would only take some small tweaks to the 2016 strategy to make this workable for 2020.  For instance, instead of, "look at all the jobs I created for you," he can say, "the only reason I haven't stopped the flood of cheap Chinese steel, or started building bridges, or revived American manufacturing is because of the militant black/immigrant/muslim thugs."

3. The other small tweak would just be to replace "jobs" with "stuff".  He can tell them, "just look at Black Lives Matter.  they're a hate group.  the 'fake news' media won't tell you that but I will.  they're a hate group and they're coming for your stuff.

4. I suspect he knows this and realizes it might be his only hope.

5. Even if he's not successful in defeating his primary challenge, he'd only need to convince a few thousand more people that the "alt-left" is coming for them for us to have some seriously violent shit on our hands.  

This strategy won't work in the sense that it won't be enough to win him the nomination.  But he doesn't need to win in order for our lives to get notably worse very soon.  I'm pretty sure he'll eventually get booted out of his seat but, like a sloppy drunk getting kicked of a dive bar, he can break a lot of shit on his way out.


# A 2-Way Street

As terrifying as it is to think about our president trying to incite a race-war, there is a reciprocal side to this that is equally terrifying.

I know this is basically impossible for any decent human but try to look at this from the perspective of one of the White Nationalist fringe groups.  They know that this is the best hand they will be delt for a long, long time.  They have been (rightfully) maligned and mocked by people of all ideologies for decades.  Looking forward, post-Trump, they can't be seeing anything promising for them on the political landscape.  But right now, right this second,  they have a guy in the White House who clearly thinks they're not all that bad.  They have to know this will never happen again in their lifetimes.  

The leadership of these groups has to be looking around the landscape and thinking, "this is our time.  We will probably never have a better opportunity than right now to get our platform into the national discussion."

# The Wrap-Up

I think we now have a president who is watching his chip stack dissipate and he's inching closer to the point where one just says, "fuck it, I'm all in."  And he's looking around for who's got his back and the only guys left in that camp are hardcore violent racists.

And, on the other hand, you have a network of these militant racists groups that have been scratching and clawing for decades to remain relevant.  They're looking at Trump like the last chance they have to mount any kind of meaningful power play.

I love the fact that people of all stripes and persuasions came out to denounce the president's tepid response to violent racist shenanigans.  But I really, really, don't like the way this chess board is starting to look for those of us hoping to live in a more inclusive society these next few years.
