# Math

First, some math...there's a lot of math on my blog and I want to make sure it will render:

$\beta = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y$

Well, that's cool and disappointing all at once...It recognized backslash-beta as a request for the Greek symbol but the math doesn't look quite right. I guess I'll have to figure out how to render equations here...Google it is.

OK, I think I've added MathJax (http://gastonsanchez.com/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/) to the site.  There seems to be some debate about which markdown engine one should be using with MathJax...I'm going to stick with Jekyll's default: Kramdown.  

Let's give this another try:

<div class="Math"> 
  $$\beta=(X'X)^{-1} X'Y$$ 
</div>.

Also, after much weeping and gnashing of teeth I discovered that the MathJax Javascript link provided by Gaston Sanchez: 

    src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"

was causing problems...the location is probably fine but I wasn't able to see the math rendered because my browser really needed the path to be:

    src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"

...the secure version.

# Code

I also like to post a decent amount of code...let's make sure I know how to do that in this new, sexy, Jekyll-Kramdown-GitHub Pages Ecosystem.

Some R code from a recent post...just to make sure we can do this in the future:
```R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot)
library(xts)
library(KFAS)
 
x = arima.sim(list(order=c(2,0,0),ar=c(1,-0.9),n=2^8)
ts.plot(x)
```
What about some python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from Quandl import Quandle as quandl 
df = quandl.get("ZILL/CO00399_MSP", authtoken="1i2uuiN7DQ-Ltizgjb_q")
print(df.head())
print(df.tail()
```
