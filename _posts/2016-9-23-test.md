# Markdown First-Level Header

First, some math...there's a lot of math on my blog and I want to make sure it will render:

$\beta = (X'X)^-1X'Y$

Well, that's disappointing...I guess I'll have to figure out how to render equations here...Google it is.

OK, I think I've added MathJax (http://gastonsanchez.com/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/) to the site.  There seems to be some debate about which markdown engine one should be using with MathJax...I'm going to stick with Jekyll's default: Kramdown.  

Let's give this another try:

<div class="Math"> $$a^2 + b^2$$ </div>.
