“A problem well posed is half solved.” -- John Dewey.

The converse is also true, a problem poorly defined will never be solved.  In my 15 years doing public policy analysis I’ve encountered few problems as poorly defined as the “affordable housing” problem.  

Here in Santa Cruz County, depending on who you talk to, we either have an affordable housing problem, an extreme affordable housing shortage, or a housing crisis. 

The claim that I will base this and future posts on is the following: I don't think anyone has a really well-developed idea of what defines our housing 'crisis.' To be clear, everybody can offer you some definition:

* people with good jobs can't find housing
* peopel who have lived here their whole lives are being 'priced out' of their homes
* median home price/rental rate is too big a fraction of median income

These are certainly symptoms of a problem...but they aren't particularly strong metrics upon which to base public policy strategies that might address our problem/shortage/crisis.

# Defining the Issue

Claim 1: The current discussion about the affordable housing ‘crisis’ in Santa Cruz County lacks a precise definition of the problem.

Based on my extensive reading of reports to the County Board of Supervisors, attendance at various public forums (including the mayor’s recent State of the City gathering), and participation in the Monterey Bay Regional Economic Partnership Planning Committee I have determined that 3 documents appear central to the current discussion of affordable housing in Santa Cruz:

The 2015 Santa Cruz County Housing Element. (http://www.sccoplanning.com/Portals/2/County/Planning/housing/2015%20Housing%20Element.pdf)
The 2014 Santa Cruz County Economic Vitality Report (http://sccoplanning.com/Portals/2/County/Planning/economicdev/economic%20vitiality%20study.pdf)
The City of Santa Cruz 2016-2017 Action Plan.  A document by the Santa Cruz Housing and Community Development Division and The Santa Cruz Economic Development Department: http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/home/showdocument?id=53604

These documents when read together give a very detailed overview of the County’s current strategy for increased provision of affordable housing.  They are unamimous in their recognition that we (Santa Cruz County) are indeed in the throws of a ‘housing crisis’.  These documents are extensive, they are delightfully data driven in a way that municipal governance document generally are not, and they reflect a deep commitment on the part of the community and city and regional governments to address the issue of availability of affordable housing.

However, a thorough reading of them reveals that nowhere in any of the planning/strategy/action documents does the city/county/whoever actually state the conditions under which we will deescalate from housing ‘crisis’ (presumbly to run-of-the-mill ‘housing problem’, ‘housing crunch’, or some other thing less scary than ‘crisis’).  I find this very problematic.  Let me offer an example:

Pg. 4-113 of the Santa Cruz County Housing Element lays out the following 6 primary housing goals:

Goal 1: Ensure land is available to accommodate an increased range of housing choices, particularly for multi-family units and smaller-sized units  

Goal 2: Encourage and Assist in the Development of Housing  

Goal 3: Remove Unnecessary Governmental Constraints to Housing  

Goal 4: Preserve and Improve Existing Housing Stock and Expand and Preserve the Continued Availability of the County’s Existing Affordable Housing.  

Goal 5: Promote Equal Opportunity and Production of Special Needs Housing Units  

Goal 6: Promote energy efficiency in existing and new residential structures

It is worth point out that none of these are actually goals in the sense of being specific, measurable aims.  These are actions.  “Ensure land is available to accommodate an increased range of housing choices, particularly for multi-family units and smaller-sized units” is not a goal.  It is not defined in such as way as to ever know if you’ve accomplished it or not.  

Everyone seems to agree that we are in an affordable housing ‘crisis’.  I’m not debating whether we are or we aren’t.  What I am saying is this: currently in Santa Cruz we have an extensive, well documented, and generally well-reasoned strategy for addressing the housing ‘crisis’.  There are multiple agencies working across multiple juristictions to develop specific actions to decrease housing insecurity for low income, special needs, and other vulnerable populations.  What we don’t have is a way of knowing when/if this combination of strategies, policies, and actions has worked.  That is,

If we are in a ‘housing crisis’ when will we know that the crisis has been abolished?    

## A Few Examples

### Example 1: Cops and Nurses

The statistics that people generally use to convey a housing problem are the ratio of home prices to median incomes and ratio of rents to median incomes.  In my experience, people often prefer to put a face on the problem.  In some circles there is a belief that the people in service professions (police officers, fire men, nurses, school teachers) should be able to afford to live in the communities they serve.  If this agrees with your notion of affordable housing then I would propose the following specific, measureable goals associated with this notion of affordable housing:

Achieve a 30% homeownership rate across the following ‘preferred professions’: police, fire, public school teachers, nurses.  
Achieve a median monthly rent that is no more than 30% of the median monthly pay in the ‘preferred professions.’
 
In the interest of developing a real success metric here we probably want to go even a step further and say, “Achieve a 30% homeownership rate across the preferred professions by 2020”..or 2025...or 2035, whatever.
 
Here it is worth noting that the median salaries for cops ($65k) and elementary school teachers ($62k) in Santa Cruz County are already consistent with the above 30% rule (65k/yr is about $5416/month which is about 3.01 times the median rent of about $1800/mo).  The homeownership metric might be a little harder nut to crack.

### Example 2: Everybody

Example 1 was consistent with a pretty conservative definition of affordable housing.  It basically said, as long as cops and nurses can get housing then we’re all good.  One the opposite end of the spectrum we go ultra liberal and say that we won’t consider Santa Cruz County affordable until every single person who wants to live here can find housing that fits their budget and lifestyle.  This goal would be both specific and measurable since meeting this goal would necessarily mean observing exactly 0 growth in rental rates and 0 growth in home prices.

This is a patently ridiculous definition but it serves as a good juxtoposition to Example 1.  If we are going to say that we are in a housing crisis because rent is too high, then we need to know what rent SHOULD BE in order for us to declare that we are no longer in a crisis.  People often don’t like to frame the issue in these terms because:

For good reasons there are some negative connotations associated with meddling in real estate markets in order to manipulate prices, and
As soon as somebody commits to a number (say we determine that achieving median rent of $1300/mo means we are no longer in a ‘crisis’) some stakeholder will immediately get pissed that his/her economic circumstances aren’t covered by the new definition of affordable.

In order to avoid the complications that come with taking about hard numbers, people often like to define ‘affordable’ using anecdotes about people who can’t find adequate housing.

We might all generally agree that Example 1 is too rigid.  Most of us probably have some vague sense that other ‘good jobs’ (bank teller, car mechanic, etc) should also be able to afford to live in Santa Cruz.  And we probably all agree that Example 2 is too vague. We can’t have a housing policy that literally says that anyone on earth who wants to live in Santa Cruz should be able to.  So in the middle is where the real action is.

Affordable housing policy is all about who should be able to afford to live where.  Nobody wants to frame the issue that way because it’s pretty dickish….but it’s the only way that will ever lead to a definition of the problem which allows us to derive the conditions under which we determine that the problem has been solved.
 

### Example 3: Median Income/Median Rent Ratio

These metrics were mentioned above but they deserve a more focused treatment.  From what I have observed the affordable housing ‘crisis’ in Santa Cruz County is often described using these metrics: The median home price (~$850,000) is about 12 times the median household income ($65k/yr) and the median family rent ($2,154) is about 40% of median monthly household income.  People in Santa Cruz generally have no qualms about telling you that median home price of $850k is ‘crazy’, ‘insane’, or ‘ridiculous’. 

But if median home price of 12 X median household income is ‘crisis’ and median home price of 3 X is affordable, where is line between ‘unaffordable’ and ‘crisis?’ When does unaffordable become a full blown ‘crisis’? 4 times median household income? 5 times median household income? 8 times?

Quick Aside Here: Yes, I know HUD and others have defined what ‘affordable housing’ means.  It’s an income based formula that defines rental rates that are within reach of above moderate, moderate, low, and very low income households.  I’m not talking about defining what ‘affordable housing’ is.  I’m talking about how we know when we’ve provided enough of it.  If we are in a ‘crisis’ now because X number of resident in our county can’t find affordable housing how much do we need to reduce X by in order to get out of ‘crisis’ mode? 


### Example 4: Section 8 Waiting List Decrease

Another subjective but not inconsequential indicator of our affordable housing problem is the extreme excess demand we have for housing assistance.  The Section 8 Housing Voucher Program is a low income housing assistance program that works by granting low income households a voucher.  They use the voucher to get rental housing on the open market and pay ⅓ of thier monthly income to the landlord in rent and the Housing Authority reimburses the landlord for the different between what the household pays in rent and the market rate (there are caps on how much the HA will reimburse).

In Santa Cruz County the waiting list for a Section 8 Housing Voucher is currently closed and there are around 5,000 households on the waiting list. 

Another possible example of a specific, measureable goal of housing policy might be:

Reduce the Section 8 Housing Voucher Wait List by 2,500 people.

We could, of course make the goal to supply all 5,000 households currently on the Section 8 waiting list with affordable housing.  But again, eliminating affordable housing need altogether seems like a pretty high bar just to move out of ‘crisis.’  What magnitude of reduction in the Section 8 waiting list would be consistent with just a regular old ‘affordable housing problem’ as opposed to a ‘crisis.’


#  Why Does it Matter

In simple terms, I think precision matters for two reasons:

1. Responsible stewardship of public money, and
2. Related to responsible stewardship, when problems aren’t precisely defined mythology is allowed to propogate and eventually becomes accepted wisdom.

The biggest reason that it matters to me is that Santa Cruz County has at least $35 million of public money invested in various programs that address affordable housing need.  I have no reason to believe that this public money is being irresponsibly spent.  However, in the absence of specific, measurable goals for eliminating our affordable housing crisis it’s hard for me to see how we can even begin to evaluate whether the current strategy is the best way to spend tens of millions of dollars.

The city and county of Santa Cruz have allocated public money to lots of different projects, under lots of different authorizations, with different (but complimentary objectives).  To their great credit they have a system for reporting progress on many of these various strategies/actions/projects which can be viewed here: 

http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/home/showdocument?id=53604

You can refer specifically to page 21, Table AP 23 to see the total amount of public monies allocated to the goal of ‘increasing and preserving affordable housing.’ Progress is reported by several ‘Goal Outcome Indicators’ for example:

Homeowner housing added
Rental units constructed
Tennant-based rental assistance/rapid rehousing 
Homelessness prevention

While I applaud the city for quantifying their progress, what I find missing from this is any discussion of what kind of impact they EXPECTED from money allocated to these initiatives.  For instance, I can use this table to see that the needs addressed were:

*Preserve existing rental housing and increase the amount and affordability of rental housing for the City’s lowest income renters.*

And I can see that a total of $4.8 million was spent from different program pots ($125k from the Community Development Block Grant Program, $125K from HUDs HOME program, $1.3 million from tax exempt bond from the general fund, $2 million from Low Income Housing Tax Credits).

And I can see that for this $4.8 million there were:

* 50 household housing units constructed under the ‘rental units constructed’ metric,
* 30 households assisted under the ‘tennent-based rental assistance/rapid rehousing’ metric
* Some other stuff

What I can’t see is what they expected to get for this money.  Is 50 household housing units a lot or a little? How big a dent in the ‘housing crisis’ do they think the addition of 50 low income rental units makes?  

To be clear, I’m not saying it didn’t make a dent.  I’m saying, numbers are great but these numbers lack context.  They’re just arbitrary numbers. 


## Implications of imprecision: The Santa Cruz ADU program

So now let me be a little more specific about what I mean by responsible stewardship of public money.  For this example I'm going to pick on a policy that have become basically a default setting for city and regional planners: encouraging construction of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs).

In Santa Cruz we have an ADU program that currently waives around $13,000 in city permitting fees for people who agree to rent their ADU as 'affordable housing' (as defined by HUD: ~850/month for very-low income households and around 900/month for low income households).  County planners are considering expanding this program by using money from the discretionary budget to incentive lenders to extend credit on extremely favorable terms to individuals wishing to develop an ADU and rent it at affordable rates.  

This is a great example of where we really need some precise understanding of what the 'crisis' is and when/how we will know the 'crisis' is over.  Incentivizing ADU development is basically a stock recommendation of all city and regional planners these days primarily (I believe) because:

1. there is very low political cost - everybody loves it because it

I'm not as opposed to ADU programs in general as people probably think.  I am skeptical of their efficacy for the following reasons:

1. It's really easy for me to see exactly how homeowners benefit and by exactly how much
2. Low income residents probably do benefit from incentivizing the addition of smaller housing units made available at below market rents.  However, the exact magnitude and extent of those benefits is at worst uncertain and at best poorly articulated.

Items 1 and 2 together basically mean that we are spending public money on a program that bestows certain and quantifiable benefits on a group of relatively wealthy people while providing uncertain and ill-defined benefits to group it is really supposed to be serving.    

One thing that particularly irritates me about subsidizing ADU development is that the people pushing for it do not generally display a deep understanding of the dyanmics of local real estate markets.  

Here is little taste of what I would like to see become a bigger part of our discussion on affordable housing.  According to the 2010 and 2015 Deciennial Census supply and demand conditions in Santa Cruz County looked something like this. 

| Unit Type          | 2015   | 2010   |
|--------------------|--------|--------|
| 1 unit detached    | 67,990  | 65,494  |
| 1 unit attached    | 8,238   | 9,351   |
| 2 units            | 3,339   | 3,917   |
| 3-4 units          | 6,482   | 5,665   |
| 5-9 units          | 3,769   | 4,154   |
| 10-19 units        | 3,142   | 2,837   |
| more than 20 units | 5,704   | 5,698   |
| mobile homes       | 6,099   | 6,707   |
| boats, RV, other   | 271    | 179    |
| Total              | 105,034 | 104,002 |
|                    |        |        |
| Median Rent        | 1,441   | 1,226   |
| Owner Occupied     | 54,628  | 55,878  |
| Owner Vacancy Rate | 1.3%   | 1.6%   |


A little algebra here can get us a few more interesting numbers.  We can ballpark the rental supply like this:

Total Owner Occupied Units = Total Owner Units X (1 - Owner Vacancy Rate)

Total Potential Rental Units = Total Housing Stock - Total Owner Units.

For 2015 we get:

$54,628 = 0.997(Owned_Units)$ 
$Owned_units = 54,628/0.997 = 54792$
$Rental_units = 105034 - 54792 = 50,242$

Using the same math for 2010 we get:

$Rental_units = 104,002 - \frac{55,878}{0.994} = 47,787$

Things do get a little complicated here because the 2010 observation of 47,787 rental units and median rent of $1,226 and 2015 observation of 50,242 rental units at a median rent of $1,446 are probably on two different demand curves (it seems likely to me that population growth and income growth probably resulted in a new demand schedule in 2015 at each price point on the 2010 demand curve).  Because we are likely dealing with 2 different demand curves we can't use price and quantity changes to infer the slope of the demand curve which complicates things.  But let's just do what I do on this blog all the time: pick some sensible number and proceed with it (we can alway do sensativity analysis later).

Let's suppose that demand for rental units in Santa Cruz is relatively inelastic such that a $100 change in median rent results in only 50 fewer rental units being demanded.

If we assume that the slope of the demand curves remains constant (i.e. we are dealing with radial expansions of the demand curve), then one very basic thing we could do is assume an expansion of the demand curve over the next 5 years that is proportional to the expansion observed from 2010 - 2015.  In that case, we would have the following demand and supply schedules in the rental market:

![r plot](/images/Rplot.png)


This clearly is not the most rigorous analysis we could conjure up but it does at least tell us one important thing: 

* if we really believe that the Rent is Just Too Damn High
* and we want to cap rent by 2020 to 2015 levels
* and we think my assumed slope of the rental market demand curves is reasonable

then if we want to deflate rent using only market supply manipulations, we would have to supply around 60,797 rental units to the market in order to get rent stablized at median levels of around $1,441.



## what does the supply and demand schedule look like?

If we want to know what kind of bang we can expect for our buck on any project we have to have some idea what the supply/demand schedule looks like.

## how many units do we need to add to get the median price down
To know this we have to know what we want the price of housing to be.  Then if we know the demand schedule we at least know how much we have to build in order to get market prices that aren’t ‘crazy.’ 


# Implications of imprecision

My pet issue: ADUs.  

# Mythology:
The claim that lack of affordable housing is linked to homelessness
The claim that small businesses and merchants can’t attract and retain qualified workers because of the high cost of housing 


# A Final Rant
 
Sociologists at the Center for Labor Studies at UCSC have been engaged in long-running research project called No Place Like Home: Affordable Housing in Crisis in Santa Cruz: http://www.noplacelikehomeucsc.org/en/.  Much like the city, county, and regional planning/action documents I’ve cited here, this appears to be the work of very well intentioned professionals.  It also, unfortunately, provides a great illustration of the seedy underbelly of the soft social sciences.  

The project has clearly done some important things...like interviewed hundreds of low income residents to better understand the ways housing costs and housing insecurity impact their lives.  As a resource for helping develop actual public policy to address affordable housing in Santa Cruz it appears to me to have very limited utility.  This is mostly because the project is basically a sprawling expanse of web-links with infographics, interesting summary statistics, and powerful anecdotes.  There is no unifying documentation that I can find anywhere (a Google Scholar search on the principal investigators turned up 0 scholarly publications related to the project, there is no .pdf on the website anywhere that has sections titled ‘Methods’ or ‘Study Design’).  It’s a collection of interesting facts and perceptions with no clearly defined research questions or testable hypothesis.   
 
I can forgive the lack of scientific integrity from city and county government reports that are generally prepared by snake-oil salesmen called consultants or severely overworked-underpaid municipal employees.  It’s harder for me to stomach when it comes from people who should know better.

It’s not that I don’t think this study is valuable, quite the opposite, I think the information obtained could be really useful.  The experiences and perceptions of the people surveyed probably could have provided answers to some important questions...but since the study designers appear not to have formulated any actual research questions, the results aren’t really answers.  They’re just a semi-organized collection of interesting anecdotes.
