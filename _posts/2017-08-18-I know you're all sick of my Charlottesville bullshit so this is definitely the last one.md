Last one then I'll shut up about this for a while I promise.

I got a lot of commentary on my last post about how awesome it is that, in the wake of the Charlottesville tragedy, white people and, in particular white male republicans, are starting to stand up and admit they made a mistake with Trump.  I agree that is awesome and promising.  I also am somewhat optomistic that we have come far enough in this country that the number of people who would never even entertain a moral equivalency between Nazis and anti-fascist protestors far outnumbers the people who might be receptive to such arguments.

My point is that our optomism should be cautious.  

# How much should we trust people like me (white males)?

Let's remember a couple things about these white male voters that we are so eager to praise now that they've forcefully castigated Trump for his Charlottesville response:

1. They are unpredictable and tend to overstate the courage of their convictions.  We know this because of the massive number of polls that incorrectly predicted a Clinton victory in 2016.  Those polls weren't arbitrarily flawed.  They overestimated Clinton's performance because a depressing number of white people, when asked, "who are you voting for" said, "I could never vote for Trump after what he said on that Access Hollywood tape," then turned around and voted for him in secret.

2. A lot of them are intellectually closer to Trump's brand of racism then they want to admit.  I know that's a horrible thing to say but so far there seem to me be a lot of equivocating responses to the question, "what do you think about Trump blaming "all sides" in Charlottesville?"  A sampling of some things I heard on a recent NPR interview with voters in Wisconsin:

*  I think he spoke out of turn but he did have a point.  Some of these protesters (it was understood he meant left wing protesters) take it too far.
* I think all this political correctness has gone too far.  I think his comments maybe weren't put in the best way but he's not politically correct and I like that about him.


First off, "political correctness" is just white people code for "I want to be able to say *N-----* and *retard*".  Let's dispense with the myth that it's anything other than that.  

Second, the people in those interviews seemed like nice enough people and probably thought of themselves as good Christians and wholesome people...but their comments demonstrate that they are already predisposed to accepting the argument that "white supremicists are bad...but there's violence on the other side too."

All one would really need to do in order to move them from latent disdain for people of color to overt distaste is to expose them to the Ferguson, MO riots on a continuous loop.  The smartest of the bunch would realize they are being manipulated...but the dumbest in the group could pretty easily go from

* "i don't think the Antifa should have responded the way they did", to 
* "there's blame on both sides"

Once you've moved to "there's blame on both sides," you're sitting squarely where Trump (and the White Nationalists by the way) want you to be.

# How stoked should we be that people are maybe rethinking thier decision to back Cheeto Jesus?

I agree that there are plenty of people who chose Trump because they thought Hillary was worse and are now regretting that.  I don't think these were latent racists or horrible people...But let's think for a second about how the Trump campaign forced that choice on people.  Hillary is not an extremist:

* she doesn't favor a $15 minimum wage
* she favored lower corporate taxes
* she wanted to amend Obamacare

These guys that we're all so proud of now for denouncing White Supremacy weren't offered a choice between 2 extremes.  They were offered a center-left candidate and a crazy man.  

The crazy man just did a *really fucking* good job of convincing all those white people that they WERE facing a choice between two extremists...and they needed to pick the extremist who was most aligned with their interests.

I think that was the point of my last post that I maybe didn't do a great job of sharpening.  All these white guys who we think would never align themselves with White Nationalists and will surely abandon Trump due to his recent antics are all looking for middle ground.  Trump is a master of removing the middle.  We've seen him do it.

Smart people are pretty good about spotting a false choice.  It's the dumb ones I'm worried about.  My fear is that Trump and his allies are going to keep chipping away at the middle with this, "violence on both sides/we're just trying to respect our history" bullshit.  

Removing monuments to confederate generals who fought for slavery isn't an extreme position.  It's pretty fucking middle ground.  And right now there are people who fancy themselves good people who are thinking:

I don't like White Supremacists and I think those monuments should probably go but I also don't like all these liberals protesting them all the time, they should get jobs.

These people fancy themselves in the middle, reasonable.  What happens when Trump keeps selling them on the idea that removing confederate monuments isn't middle ground, it's an extreme left position:

* just look at what they did in schools - you can't even pray any more.  pretty soon they'll ban the pledge of alliance
* just look at what they did with football - you can't even call your team the Redskins anymore without somebody filing a law suit
* today it's Confederate Generals but Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, do we have to remove his monuments too? And what's after that? Are they gonna make us take down statues of Davy Crockett because he was a murdered? Or Paul Bunyon because he wasn't good to the environment?

In my experience one wouldn't have to cycle through the list above for very long (and possibly run the tape of the Ferguson Riots for a few minutes) before a bunch of dumb motherfuckers went from,

"I think the monuments should probably go", to

"they're trying to erase our culture."

# Final Words

Here, and in my last post, I've been making the case that, by removing the (theoretical/intellectual/whatever) middle Trump can grow his  support.  Convince people that there is no middle and they have to chose right or left and a decent number are going to choose "right".  I think that Trump is very good at manipulating people into thinking there is no center.  And I think his strategists are starting to realize this is one of their best plays.

I'm really not trying to be Debbie Downer, I don't think the world is going to hell anytime soon.  But I also don't think we should underestimate:

1. The ability of Trump to manipulate otherwise well-meaning, compassionate people, and

2. The possibility of escalating racial tensions that could happen if a few more people are pushed, "the monuments should probably go" to, "they're trying to erase our culture."
