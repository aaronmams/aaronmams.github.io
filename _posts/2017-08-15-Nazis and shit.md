There have been a lot of words written on the subject of our national tragedy in Charlottesville, VA lately...most of them by people much more eloquent and precise than me.  Here's my take on how this tragedy reflects on our society.  Spoiler alert: it's not good.

# Some Bad News

If you are not already a raging pessimist then I have some bad news for you regarding Charlottesville: however bad you think this situation is, it's probably much worse.  

I've been listening to well meaning people say things like

"We won't let them win"

and 

"Hate won't win"

For those people I have really bad news: They ARE winning.  

# The Overton Window

Think about the [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) for a minute and realize that this is what winning looks like to them (the Nazis).  Right now quasi-legitimate new outlets are discussing and debating whether *Black Lives Matter* is a hate group.  They are discussing whether a group protesting the alarming rate at which unarmed black men are being systematically brutalized by law enforcement should be classified in the same bin as Nazi skinheads.  

The Overton Window refers to the window of topics deemed acceptable to debate in the public sphere.  Two years ago, before the election of Cheeto Jesus, the suggestion that Nazis and White Supremacists were no different, no more extreme than Black Lives Matter, would have gotten you laughed off any news network (yes, even Fox News).  When we started calling them the "alt-right" that's when they started winning.  That was the shift in the Overton Window that Nazis have been working on for decades.

Here's the thing: we crave centrism in our thought processes.  So much so that if we know there is an "alt-right" we are immediately predisposed to accept the existence of an "alt-left."  We love to think that there are extremes on both sides.  This is exceptionally dangerous because it allows horrible people like Nazis to paint themselves as a reasonable counter-balance to some theoretical extreme on the other end (another spoiler alert: there is no "alt-left").

I know I sound like a tin-foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist right now but when Richard Spencer started using the term "alt-right" I think he was planning for something.  I think he knew there would be a day (like today) when we had heard "alt-right" so frequently that it wouldn't even seem out of place to slip "alt-left" into the lexicon.    

Nazis and White Supremacists don't have to convince people they are right.  They just have to convince some people that they're not crazy. 

This is winning to them.  They don't need to convert everyone..they just need to convince some people that, "there are two sides to every story."  

# The Tea Party

Think about the Tea Party for a second.  A group of ultra-conservative political representatives that have promised on multiple occasions to shut down our government.  Did they rise to prominence on the power of their ideas and ideology?  Hell no! They convinced a bunch of yokals that the black boogie man was using the levers of government to set up his Communist Commune with their hard earned disability checks.  They painted themselves as a counter-balance to a leftist extreme that didn't/doesn't/never existed.  They set up a ultra-leftist straw-man then appealed to a "two sides to every story" argument to force people into a false choice between bread lines and their conservative utopia.

# Global Warming

If you ever doubt how powerful the erroneous, "there are two sides" statement is, remember that 100% of people with any remedial knowledge of science agree that our planet is warming and humans are the primary cause.  But a small group of kooks have succeeded in sowing doubt about that fact in the minds of millions of Americans simply by appealing to the fallacious, "there are two sides" argument.  Climate deniers haven't even had to satisfy the burden of offering factually correct evidence of their point.  That is, they haven't even had to posit a second side that competes with science and informed decision making.  All they had to do was sell the average Joe on the IDEA that global warming might be a farce because, "there are two sides to each story."

# Final Words

I don't have any good advice here. I'm at a loss.  The alt-right is winning and I'm not convinced there's much that good people can do about it.  Sadly, I don't think we are stupid and irredeemable as a people...but I do know there will always be enough stupid people to where the Nazis only need to dupe half of them to have a decent crop.

I heard an expression today that I liked.  A colleague said, "well, I guess it's good to know how many cockroaches are under the floorboards."

But here's the thing about that: if there's even 1 cockroach, then the cockroaches are winning.  In the game of me versus the cockroaches there are only two outcomes:

1. there are 0 cockroaches and I live in my house without incident, or
2. there are 1 or possibly more and I sleep with the lights on in paralyzing fear of waking up at night to the feeling of a cockroach on my leg.

Right now the Nazis are winning because the bar for them is set very low.  They don't have to convince good, morally grounded, educated, intelligent people that they are palatable.  They just have to convince the dumbest among us that they aren't crazy.
