Arthur Laffer has a new piece of anti-tax propaganda out called [So Long, California. Sayonara New York](https://www.wsj.com/articles/so-long-california-sayonara-new-york-1524611900) and, consistent with Laffer's *modus operandi*, it's a real festival of non-evidence-based pontification.

# Claims

A. Relatively high state and local taxes drive migration - people, on balance, leave high tax states and move to low tax states.
B. Net migration is bad for state budgets.

It is important to note that in order for Laffer's prescription

*As far as we can see, the only way for blue states to prevent this coming fiscal bloodbath is to start taking tax competitiveness seriouslyâ€”and to cut their tax rates in response. Progressives should do the math: A 13% tax rate generates zero revenue from someone who leaves the state for friendlier climes.*

to be valuable/accurate/not stupid, both claims A and B must be simultaneously true.  

That is, it must be the case that:

1. People are leaving California BECAUSE of the high tax structure, and
2. Rich people are leaving at higher rates than poor people

# Evaluating the Claims

The authors offer, as evidence of point A, the fact that since 2007 California and New York have lost more than 2.2 million residents.  I don't dispute this fact...but saying that people left isn't the same as saying that people left BECAUSE state and local taxes were too high.  

## Do high taxes drive out-migration of rich people

### Some academic evidence
[Young and Varner, 2011[(http://web.stanford.edu.oca.ucsc.edu/~cy10/public/NTJ-millionaire-migration-state-taxation.pdf) find little to no outmigration of high income individuals in response to a 'millionaire's tax'.  

In a follow-up analysis [Young, Varner, Lurie, and Prisinzano, 2016](http://journals.sagepub.com.oca.ucsc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/0003122416639625) find:

*We find that millionaire tax flight is occurring, but only at the margins of statistical and socioeconomic significance.*

### Some empirical evidence

If high state and local taxes were causing large scale tax-flight among high earners we should see this reflected in the changes in distribution of income.  Put simply, if all the rich people are leaving California because high taxes then the median per capita income should be going down.  It's not.  California has been a high tax state since at least the 1990s.  

California did experience a notable decline in real household income from 2008 - 2011 when the housing market crashed.  But from 2011 - 2016 median household income in California grew faster (3%/year) than Texas (2%/year).  Once again, if Laffer's assumptions are right and all the rich people left California because of high taxes and moved to Texas, then we should have seen California's median household income drop...and we should have seen Texas's median household income rise faster than high tax states.

## Summary


| Evidence for tax flight | Evidence for no tax flight |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Arthur Laffer says so   | Young and Varner (2011) a rigorous cross-state difference-in-differences study |
|                         | Young et al. (2016) a rigorous 13 year study of millionaires' tax returns    |
|                         | Median household income in California going up not down|

Just to be clear, I'm not saying tax flight isn't a real thing.  I'm not claiming to have rigorously tested the tax flight hypothesis.  However, Arthur Laffer and the Wall Street Journal ARE claiming that:

1. tax flight is real
2. it's going to get worse
3. California is going broke unless they lower state and local taxes

And what's truly amazing (but I guess not really that amazing if you're familar with Art Laffer's particular brand of snake oil peddling) is that Laffer and the WSJ are making these dire economic prognotications in the complete absence of any reputable supporting empirical evidence for their position.

# Now for something a little different

A caveat: Laffer (and a bunch of other kooky supply side zealots) were fabulously wrong about the inflationary ramifications of the Fed's policy of Quantitative Easing.  In 2009 Laffer wrote a [screed in the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124458888993599879) asserting that the Federal Reserve's policy of Quantitative Easing was sure precipitate price inflation that would "make the 70's look benign" and should be immediately discontinued.

[To Laffer's credit he was reasonably open about being wrong](http://www.businessinsider.com/arthur-laffer-interview-2014-1)

*Usually when you find the model this far off, you've probably got something wrong with the model, not that the world has changed," he said. "Inflation does not appear to be monetary base driven*

I've made the case above that Arthur Laffer is talking out of his ass when it comes to tax flight and whether or not California should cut state and local taxes.  Now I want to take the discussion a step further and try to convince you that Arthur Laffer is, in general, a kook whose economic hallucinations should no longer be taken seriously.
