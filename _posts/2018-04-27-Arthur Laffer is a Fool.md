Arthur Laffer has a new piece of anti-tax propaganda out called [So Long, California. Sayonara New York](https://www.wsj.com/articles/so-long-california-sayonara-new-york-1524611900) and, consistent with Laffer's *modus operandi*, it's a real festival of non-evidence-based pontification.

# Claims

A. Relatively high state and local taxes drive migration - people, on balance, leave high tax states and move to low tax states.
B. Net migration is bad for state budgets.

It is important to note that in order for Laffer's prescription

*As far as we can see, the only way for blue states to prevent this coming fiscal bloodbath is to start taking tax competitiveness seriouslyâ€”and to cut their tax rates in response. Progressives should do the math: A 13% tax rate generates zero revenue from someone who leaves the state for friendlier climes.*

to be valuable/accurate/not stupid, both claims A and B must be simultaneously true.  

That is, it must be the case that:

1. People are leaving California BECAUSE of the high tax structure, and
2. Rich people are leaving at higher rates than poor people

# Evaluating the Claims

The authors offer, as evidence of point A, the fact that since 2007 California and New York have lost more than 2.2 million residents.  I don't dispute this fact...but saying that people left isn't the same as saying that people left BECAUSE state and local taxes were too high.  

## Do high taxes drive out-migration of rich people

### Some academic evidence
[Young and Varner, 2011[(http://web.stanford.edu.oca.ucsc.edu/~cy10/public/NTJ-millionaire-migration-state-taxation.pdf) find little to no outmigration of high income individuals in response to a 'millionaire's tax'.  

In a follow-up analysis [Young, Varner, Lurie, and Prisinzano, 2016](http://journals.sagepub.com.oca.ucsc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/0003122416639625) find:

*We find that millionaire tax flight is occurring, but only at the margins of statistical and socioeconomic significance.*

### Some empirical evidence

If high state and local taxes were causing large scale tax-flight among high earners we should see this reflected in the changes in distribution of income.  Put simply, if all the rich people are leaving California because high taxes then the median per capita income should be going down.  It's not.  California has been a high tax state since at least the 1990s.  

California did experience a notable decline in real household income from 2008 - 2011 when the housing market crashed.  But from 2011 - 2016 median household income in California grew faster (3%/year) than Texas (2%/year).  Once again, if Laffer's assumptions are right and all the rich people left California because of high taxes and moved to Texas, then we should have seen California's median household income drop...and we should have seen Texas's median household income rise faster than high tax states.
